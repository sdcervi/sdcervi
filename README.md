# Who I am
**Stephanie Cervi (she/her)**

I'm a graphic and web designer located in the Monterey Bay Area. I've been doing this since January of 2012, and my services include [graphic design](https://stephaniecervi.net/graphic-design), [web design](https://stephaniecervi.net/web-design), [vector drawings](https://stephaniecervi.net/vector-renderings), [print design](https://stephaniecervi.net/print-design), and [photography](https://stephaniecervi.net/photography).

# Why you should hire me

## For a vector drawing
Graphic and web design are major parts of what I do, but vector illustrations and renderings are my bread and butter. If you're looking to give the perfect gift to your favorite petrol-head, then consider a custom rendering of their automotive companion. So far, I've done Miatas, Maseratis, Ferraris, and even a Lamborghini Countach. These renderings are truly one-of-a-kind, and the finished product comes printed on high-quality matte gicl√©e paper.

## For website design
I'm well-versed in usability and accessibility standards. I emphasize cleanliness and simplicity of design, making sure that everything I do is visually pleasing and easy to use for users of all capabilities. While the surface appearance of your website is all that a user will see, I look beyond that into what really sets a good website apart from one that is truly great.

## For logo and print design
My logos embody my design language: clean lines and easy to read. I strive to capture the essence of your company or brand in a simple graphic that is well-suited to all applications, from polo shirts to soap bars. If your logo is instantly recognizable and tells the world what you do and who you are, I've done my job.

When it comes to flyers, t-shirts, and any other printed material, I apply the same pixel-perfect attention to detail to give you the best-looking assets possible. Combine a print piece with my logo design package and you can be sure that the results will be eye-catching and unique.
